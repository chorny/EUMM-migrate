eumm-migrate is a tool to migrate from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build.
It executes Makefile.PL with fake ExtUtils::MakeMaker and rewrites all parameters for
WriteMakefile into corresponding params of Module::Build->new. Calls to 'prompt' are also
intercepted and corresponding 'prompt' is written to Build.PL. All other info should be ported
manually.

Just run eumm-migrate.pl in directory with Makefile.PL. If you use Github, Internet connection
is recommended.

eumm-migrate tries to automatically detect some properties like license, minimum Perl version
required and repository used.
